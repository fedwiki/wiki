Since the earlier creation of the node version, to complement the original Ruby implementation, there has been a risk of the two versions diverging. A first step to prevent divergence was to extract the client code into the [wiki-client](https://github.com/WardCunningham/wiki-client). This wiki-client was then used by both the Ruby and Node servers. However, with both server repositories retained the static components of the client, together with the plug-ins there remained some risk of divergence.

In this latest version of the node version of Federated Wiki, we continue by:
* including all the client components in the wiki-client, and
* moving all plug-ins into their own repositories, see below for a list.

When we originally extracted the wiki-client, we included it back into wiki whilst building the wiki package. This had the unforeseen consequence that when creating an updated wiki-client it was also necessary to create a new version of the wiki package for the updated client to be available. To avoid this we no longer include wiki packages in the package for the server.

Here we have a new wiki repository, and package, which only exist to pull together the federated wiki modules (wiki-node-server, wiki-client, and plug-ins) and start the server.

## Using Federated Wiki

## Running your own Server

The quickest way to set up wiki on your local machine is to install it globally with `npm`:

    $ npm install -g wiki
    $ wiki

Visit localhost:3000 to see your wiki. If you choose a host visible to the internet then others in the federation can use your work.

## Updating the Server Software

From time to time some of the packages that makeup the wiki software will be updated. To see if updates are available for any of the wiki packages, run:

    $ npm outdated --silent -g | grep '^Package\|^wiki'

If there are any updates available, the globally installed wiki can be updated by re-installing it:

    $ npm install -g wiki

We have to install as running `npm update -g wiki` will only work if the wiki package itself has been updated.

An alternative approach would be to run `npm update` in the directory containing the wiki install. The location for running this will vary depending on which platform you are on.

If you installed the wiki package locally, rather than globally, you can run `npm outdated --silent | grep '^Package\|^wiki'` and `npm update` in the directory you installed the wiki package.

## Server Options

Options for the server can be passed in many ways:

* As command line flags
* As a configuration JSON file specified with --config
* As a config.json file in the root folder or cwd.
* As env vars prefixed with `wiki_`

Higher in the list takes precedence.
The server will then try to guess all unspecified options.

### Neighborhood Seeding

Two options are added for seeding a neighborhood.

When running a server farm `--autoseed` will populate the neighborhood with the other sites in the farm that have been
visited.

Adding `--neighbours 'comma separated list of sites'` will add those sites to the neighborhood.

### Datastore options

---

**NOTE:** This release sees a change in how the support for different
datastores is provided, and how they are configured. The previous
configuration method is *depreciated*, and will be removed in a future version.

---

A number of datastores are supported. Use the --database and --data options to configure, or use the config.json.

The default location of the datastore is ```~/.wiki```, which contains two sub-directories ```pages``` and ```status```:
* ```pages``` is used with flatfiles, or leveldb, to store your pages, and
* ```status``` stores the site's favicon, and a file containing the identity (email address) of the site owner.

#### flatfiles (default)

The default path to store page data is in a "default-data" subdirectory of the install directory. You can override it like this:

    $ wiki --data FILESYSTEM_PATH

#### leveldb

Support for leveldb is added by installing the `wiki-storage-leveldb` package, this can be
achieved by running `npm install wiki-storage-leveldb -save` in this directory.

The leveldb datastore uses JSON encoded leveldb format and is configured by providing a filesystem path:

    $ wiki --database '{"type": "leveldb"}' --data FILESYSTEM_PATH

The leveldb datastore allows for a graceful upgrade path. If a page is not found in leveldb the flatfile datastore will be consulted.


#### Database Datastores

---

**NOTE:** Database datastore will NOT work when the server is run in farm mode.

---


##### mongodb

Support for mongoDB is added by installing the `wiki-storage-mongodb` package, this can be
achieved by running `npm install wiki-storage-mongodb -save` in this directory.

The mongodb connection arguments are specified as follows:

    $ wiki --database '{"type": "mongodb", "url": "...", "options": {...}}'

For convenience the url will also be read from MONGO_URI, MONGOLAB_URI, or MONGOHQ_URL. This smooths the Heroku deployment process somewhat.

The mongodb datastore allows for a graceful upgrade path. If a page is not found in mongodb the flatfile datastore will be consulted.

##### redis

Support for redis is added by installing the `wiki-storage-redis` package, this can be
achieved by running `npm install wiki-storage-redis -save` in this directory.

The Redis connection arguments are specified as follows:

    $ wiki --database '{"type": "redis", "host": "...", "port": nnn, "options": {...}}'

The Redis datastore allows for a graceful upgrade path. If a page is not found in redis the flatfile datastore will be consulted.



##### Example config.json for Redis

```
{
  "database" : {
    "type" : "redis",
    "host" : "your.redis_instance.com",
    "port" : 6379,
    "options": { "auth_pass" : "all_mimsy_were_the_borogroves" }
  }
}
```

### Run Wiki in Docker containers with different storage backends

[Fig](http://www.fig.sh/install.html) allows to easily spin up docker containers with multiple wiki apps, couchdb and redis storage.
It is configured through `fig.yml`. By uncommenting the redis and or couchdb paragraghs in `fig.yml` more containers can be started.

     $ fig up

If you are not installing the wiki components locally you will need to build the app container by running:

     $ fig build
     $ fig run web npm install
     $ fig up

Visit $dockerhost:3000 to see your wiki.
On OsX $dockerhost can be determined by running: `boot2docker ip` . On Linux the containers bind to 0.0.0.0
The wiki-node source directory gets mounted into the app containers under /usr/src/app


## Participation

We're happy to take issues or pull requests regarding the goals and
their implementation within this code.

A wider-ranging conversation is documented in the GitHub ReadMe of the
founding project, [SFW](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki/blob/master/ReadMe.md).

The [contributing page](./contributing.md) provides details of the repositories that form the node.js version of Federated Wiki, together with some guidance for developers.
